	<p>Now we have a million pixels. That is still easy to imagine, megapixels have been around for ages now.</p>

	<p>This rectangle contains an amount of pixels equivalent to the Avogadro constant.</p>
	<p>18 grams of water also contain the Avogadro constant of water molecules. This is called a mole.</p>
	<p>Is that easy to imagine?</p>
	<p>Now look at yourself.</p>
	<p>All your blood and cell tissues, they contain thousands of moles of water.</p>
	<p>All the proteins, fat, carbohydrates that your body is made of contain moles and moles and moles of carbon.</p>
